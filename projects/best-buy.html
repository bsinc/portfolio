      <p>I am currently working as a Digital Designer on the eCommerce team at Best Buy Canada. I use visual design to create thoughtful online shopping and sale experiences for customers on a weekly basis while working alongside UX, Copywriters, Marketing, and Business Specialists. I have been a key team member in countless product launches as well as many customer experience improvements to the website. Please scroll on through and have a look at a few highlights.</p>

      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>Combining all this stuff together (working with stakeholders and UX and copy and business), we came to a solution that benefits the customer first and foremost. Since as a Digital Designer I am under the Retail Experience umbrella, meaning I am a champion for the customer. Below you can see the before and after of the redesign. This was my first major project at Best Buy and I am really proud of the way it turned out. We were able to create a useful navigational experience, while also allowing customers to browse and explore the deals or new products.</p>

      <h2>Product Launches</h2>
      <p>At Best Buy we aim to have the latest and greatest products available for our customers as soon as possible. I have been part of a number of product launches during my time there, including Microsoft Surface, iPhone XS, MacBook Pro, and Samsung Galaxy S10. Many of these launches have a turn around time of 24 hours or less.</p>
      <p>We work tirelessly to launch new products online with an amazing customer experience. This is a huge team effort with multiple teams across the building communicating and coordiating with each other constantly. Because of this amazing teamwork, we are often the first Canadian online retailer to have the new products live on our site.</p>
      <p>The most daunting launches are the new flagship phones from Apple, Samsung, or Google. Because of the limited capabilities of our website the team "hacked" together a pre-order experience for these phones. This allowed the customer to not only learn more about the new phones, but choose exactly which model, colour, and carrier they wanted to buy. I helped alter existing code for every phone launch in the last year. This means I was coding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to get this tool up and running for our customers.</p>
      <p>Below are some highlights of launches we've worked on, as well as some behind the scenes of our pre-order tool.</p>

      <h2>PC Gaming at Best Buy</h2>
      <p>I collaborated with UX and Copywriters to create a hub for customers to explore all things PC Gaming at Best Buy. I had so much fun working on the creative elements. Working with a creative that is all about bold colours, movement, and speed is really exciting. It enables me to bring the products to life and make the page feel engaging to the customer.</p>
