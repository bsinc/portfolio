      <h2>PC Gaming at Best Buy</h2>
      <p>I collaborated with UX and Copywriters to create a hub for customers to explore all things PC Gaming at Best Buy. I had so much fun working on the creative elements. Working with a creative that is all about bold colours, movement, and speed is really exciting. It enables me to bring the products to life and make the page feel engaging to the customer.</p>

      <h2>Best Buy Mobile Category Redesign</h2>
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>The problem the team was trying to solve was that customers were landing on this category page, spending too much time only to then leave without navigating further or getting to a product page. The bounce rate was high and the page was filled with promotional offers, denying the customer the opportunity to learn the breadth of products Best Buy has available. </p>
      <p>To start, our team gathered members from a multitude of teams into a working session. Here we agreed on the problem, understood our stakeholders point of view, and worked together to make a sticky-note wireframe. We then took all the feedback and ideas back to our design team to further develop a wireframe and understand what our KPIs were.</p>

      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>We came to a solution that benefits the customer first and foremost. Below you can see the before and after of the redesign. We were able to create a useful navigational experience, while also allowing customers to browse and explore the hottest deals or new products.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>Our team was incredibly happy with the results we saw after just one month of the redesign going live to production. The bounce rate decreased significantly, matching up with other categories of the same level. Perhaps the biggest win was that the time a customer spent on the page decreased by nearly a minute. This means that customers are able to understand the purpose of the page much faster and can navigate to the sub-categories they are trying to find with ease.</p>
